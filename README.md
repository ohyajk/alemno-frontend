# Alemno React Assignment 

1. Clone this repo
2. Use "npm run dev" to spin up react and use the app.

  
*** I made an express backend in this repo in case the backend is not accessible - https://github.com/ohyajk/alemno-backend
but you will have to connect your own Mongodb using the MONGO_URL variable in a .env file locally.
